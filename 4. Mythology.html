           <h1>1.KARNA'S WIFE: THE OUTCAST'S QUEEN</h1>
           Picking up a slice of Mahabharata, the epic tale of fight good and evil, justice and injustice , Kaurava and Pandav’s,
           Kavita Kane, the author, narrates the poignant story of the unsung hero Karna from the eyes of a lesser-known character, Urvi.
           The book renders a unique perspective to the venerable legend. Written in the genre of magic-realism the book reflects various
           aspects of Karna’s nature. His unquestionable loyalty towards Duryodhana who in turn has unconditional love for the former, 
           the ghosts of Karna’s past and the mystery surrounding his birth are some of the themes that Kavita Kane structures her book
           around in this tale. The accomplished Kshatriya princess, Urvi falls for the Sutputra-Karna, eventually discounting Arjun.
           She chooses Karna over her childhood mate Arjun and faces fury from many. Caught between the social implications from her 
           act of defiance and her endeavours to gain respect and love from her husband, Urvi’s struggles as the outcast’s queen have 
           been explored. Urvi soon secures a key place in Karna’s life as a friend, counsellor and confidante. Between fighting her 
           own demons, she stands firm by her husband’s side, supporting Karna through all his misfortunes and struggles. As Karna’s 
           wife, the outcast’s queen, shows a refreshing facet of the battle of Kurukshetra and how the outcast rose above his destiny 
           to be forever regarded as ‘Daata Karna’.<br>

            the doomed palace of Ayodhya, their smiles, hope and joy wiped away in a single stroke. And through the tears and the tragedy 
            one woman of immense strength and conviction stands apart—Urmila, whose husband, Lakshman, has chosen to accompany his brother
            Ram to the forest rather than stay with his bride. She could have insisted on joining Lakshman, as did Sita with Ram. But she
            did not. Why did she agree to be left behind in the palace, waiting for her husband for fourteen painfully long years?From

            <h1>3. KESHAVA: A MAGNIFICIENT OBSESSION</h1>
            Everyone associated with Sri Krishna believes that their relationship with the deity is unique, which explains why every gopika
            felt that the Lord was dancing with her at the Maharaas. That is Sri Krishna’s magic and also his power that he becomes the 
            centre of their existence. He has that effect on not just humans but on everything on the planet—both living and non-living.
            This book is about Sri Krishna’s relationship with nature; the Peacock, the Kadamba tree, the Flute, the herbal plant Tulsi, 
            the Lotus, his cow Kamadhenu, the Conch and the Peepala tree. All of them believe that Keshava loves them the most. Can this be
            true? Keshava, A Magnificent Obsession is the story of these special bindings, stories of passion, submission, devotion and of
            uncontainable desire.<br>
