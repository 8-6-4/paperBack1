            Born in Cheetham, Manchester, England, Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849-1924) developed her love for reading at a very young age. 
            In 1868, Burnett’s first story was published in Godey’s Lady’s Book. She had begun writing for a livelihood and wrote non-stop.
            Her stories were being published on a regular basis in Peterson’s Magazine, Harper’s Bazaar and Scribner’s Monthly. That Lass 
            o’ Lowrie’s, her first full-length novel, was published in 1877. She started writing children’s fiction after meeting Louisa 
            May Alcott and Mary Mapes Dodge—the editor of St. Nicholas, a children’s magazine.<br>

            <h1>3. NETTLE & BONE</h1> 
            Whimsical Tales, Gothic feels, a Found Family, a Dog that's not a Dog, a Hen with a Demon, Curses, Crypts, Ghosts, Godmothers and
            a Vile Prince - Nettle and Bone gives you a combination of all of this and some more!We get a delightful mixture of characters in
            this story.An ordinary forgotten princess who is really a Nun, a sweet, harmless Godmother, a Witch (of sorts), and a warrior 
            turned slave form an unlikely group to carry out an impossible task - destroy the Evil Prince.Faced against insurmountable odds 
            and an entire battalion of creepy, evil ghosts and the power of a centuries old curse, their mission seems like a mad venture. 
            But they persevere.Throughout the book, the author is trying to make a point that often times, people are not what they seem.
            Cruelty can lie hidden under a veneer of respectability. And the one's towards whom we look with contempt and disgust might have
            a wealth of kindness in them if we could just bother to treat them properly.<br>
