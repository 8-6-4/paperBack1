        <h1>1. DEVI</h1>
        Somewhere in a faraway village, there is the ruin of an ancient temple where no one worships. If you happen to come across it someday,
        you should bow your head and walk away. Do not be tempted to go in, and temped you will be, for the Devi of the temple grants wishes.
        But she must be promised something in return.Aditi talked to the stars when she was married to a man ten years older than herself, 
        and they whispered to her that she was responsible for her own happiness. And that was what she had been struggling to do, searching
        for moments of joy in a patriarchal society… until she had to shift with her husband to Ufrail, a remote village in Bihar infamous 
        for its blood-curdling history.And then she hears about the temple of the Devi… and she is tempted! It was thrilling, scary, horrific,
        surprising, satisfying, altogether it was a different experience. I love how the element of surprise was always there in the book,
        which for me is very important in a horror book for it to be interesting.From first chapter till the last one, my excitement was to 
        another level. For all the horror fiction lovers out there, you should definitely read this book.<br>

        <h1>3. WHEN THE DEVIL WHISPERS</h1>
        The plot is so dangerously well placed that it left me out of breath towards the very end. The way everything came together was the
        most excitement I've had in months. More than anything, the experience I had reading this thriller/horror was insanely satisfying. 
        It was like a disneyland ride. It started off slow and boy oh boy, as the end neared, it kept me on the edge of my seat. I am
        definitely going to read it again keeping the end in mind, because it seemed to me like the author has given several clues since the 
        beginning, but we just tend to overlook it. It was one of those books where every line mattered. You missed reading a sentence and 
        you've missed a very important part of the plot. And don't even get me started on the cliffhangers. Oh sweet lord of books, I love 
        this one so much. What a brilliant thriller. When the Devil Whispers is a gruesome story of kidnappings and killings narrated in gory
        detail by Ajinkya Bhasme. The book is quite gripping. Although it is apparently based on a real case, the writer should have 
        simplified it because a plethora of police inspectors and other characters tend to confuse the reader.<br>
        <h5> ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</h5>
        Bhasme carefully crafts his works based on sever mental illness. He uses his research background from IIT Bombay and his diploma in 
        psychotherapy to dissect the most complicated stories human minds have to offer. His work is known to be fresh and on topics that have
        never been touched before.Bhasme's work has garnered him many national and international literary accolades from some of the most 
        reputed media houses in the world. His books are known to be scary but have many trails of unsaid wisdom between the empty spaces.<br>
