        <h1>1. PREM PURANA: MYTHOLOGICAL LOVE STORIES</h1>
        Stories of love and extraordinary devotion
        No one is untouched by love, not even devas (gods) and asuras (demons), kings and nymphs. And when they face life’s unexpected 
        tribulations, their love also undergoes trials. Read how Ganesha took myriad forms to please Riddhi, Siddhi and Buddhi, how Ravana 
        shared an unbreakable bond with his true love, Mandodari and how Nal and Damayanti’s relationship was tested till nothing remained.
        Tormented by passion, wracked by betrayal, torn by the agony of separation, love in its many splendored forms is the origin of these
        incredibly endearing stories of Prem Purana.<br>
